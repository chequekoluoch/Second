    Usually, the kinds of probes and reagents necessary to run this test in a clinical setting take years to develop and to
    apply for regulatory approval, explained Ahmed Kalebi, a lead consultant pathologist based in Kenya, working with the
    private Lancet Group of Laboratories.
    
    But, as soon as Chinese health authorities released the full genome of 2019-nCoV in mid-January, research-level labs
    such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta and other WHO-designated reference laboratories began preparing
    their own probes using the genetic sequence provided – what Kalebi and others in the industry call a “homebrew”.
    
    Often, when people think of test kits, they think of “rapid kits” like those that test for malaria and can yield results
    almost instantly.
    
    But, while rapid kits are easier to use, it is much more difficult to develop them and ensure accuracy. Rapid kits
    depend on a process called “immunoassay”, which detects not the actual genetic material of a virus but rather the
    antibodies that a person has developed against the infection.
    
    “We have the oven to bake the cake, so to speak, but no ingredients.”
    
    In order to develop an immunoassay-based test kit, researchers first need to develop the antigen protein that can be
    used to test the antibody - it’s a complicated process that takes more time, which is why rapid kits are only starting
    to be produced now.
    
    Both public- and private-run laboratories in Kenya have the equipment to run molecular assays – used to analyse genetic
    material – but for now what is missing are the key probes and reagents.
    
    “We have the oven to bake the cake, so to speak, but no ingredients,” Kalebi told The New Humanitarian.
    
    So, when the suspected coronavirus patient was being rushed from the airport to hospital in Nairobi, the Kenyan Ministry
    of Health was already working to identify a suitable WHO-designated laboratory with access to 2019-nCoV probes and the
    right reagents to run a diagnostic test.
    
    Ultimately, Kenya chose the National Institute on Communicable Disease in Johannesburg.

    The Pharmaceutical Society of Kenya (PSK) has designed a plan that would make it easier for patients to access medical
marijuana.
The medics want Parliament to amend the law to ensure controlled production and supply of cannabis because it’s a matter
of both improving public health, and ‘accepting the reality’. The ban on cannabis denies patients access to its
medicinal value.

MEDICINAL USE
Following the introduction of the Marijuana Control Bill in 2018, the PSK interrogated the medicinal benefits of
cannabis and the necessary regulation that would accompany non-prohibition of its supply for medicinal use.

The society recommends implementation of the provision in Section 3 Subsection 3 of the Narcotics and Psychotropic
